# Kickback
This Java & Android library helps to manage static data more structurally using annotation processor.

## Including in your project
#### build.gradle
```java
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.skydoves:kickback:1.0.2'
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.skydoves:kickback-processor:1.0.2'
    kapt 'com.github.skydoves:kickback-processor:1.0.2' // for kotlin project
}
```

## Usage
Create an abstract class with @KickbackBox annotation. <br>
@KickbackBox annotation means integration management class about static objects.

```java
@KickbackBox(name = "Profile")
public abstract class UserProfile {
    final int visits = 1;

    @KickbackElement(name = "name")
    final String userName = "skydoves";

    @Weak
    @KickbackElement(name = "password")
    final int userPassword = 1234;

    @Weak
    @KickbackElement(name = "secondPassword")
    final int userSecondPassword = 12345;

    @Soft
    @KickbackElement(name = "dog")
    Dog userDog;

    @Soft
    UserPrivates userPrivates;
}
```
@KickbackElement annotation decides name tag of a variable.<br>
If not annotated, the default name of the variable will be field name.<br>
@Weak and @Soft annotation make an instance of a field to weak or soft reference.<br><br>

After builds your project, Kickback_(box name) class will be auto-generated by Kickback like below.
```java
public class Kickback_Profile implements LifecycleObserver {
  private static Integer kickback_Visits = 1;

  private static String kickback_Name = "skydoves";

  private static WeakReference<? extends Integer> kickback_Password = new WeakReference(1234);
  
  public static void setVisits(Integer visits) {
    kickback_Visits = visits;
  }

  public static void setName(String name) {
    kickback_Name = name;
  }

  public static void setPassword(Integer password) {
    kickback_Password = new WeakReference(password);
  }
  // -- skiped --
```
Then we can put, take out or free at memory into our new generated box class.
```java
Kickback_Profile.setName("Kickback");
Kickback_Profile.getName();
Kickback_Profile.freeName();
```
In Android project, we can set LifecycleObserver and get LifecycleObserver from box class.<br>
Using by these methods, we can more prevent from OOM on your project.
```java
kickback_profile.setLifecycleObserver(LifecycleOwner lifecycleOwner)
kickback_profile.getLifecycleObserver()
```
